# Hi, I'm Lennon101



**R&D Engineer**  
Environmental industry — embedded systems, firmware, and sensor development.

I design and build end-to-end systems: hardware, firmware, data pipelines, and the tools that tie them together.

## Focus Areas

- Embedded systems (ARM, Raspberry Pi Pico, Atmel)  
- Firmware development in C, C++, Arduino, and Python  
- PCB design and sensor integration (Altium)  
- IoT and self-hosted infrastructure (Home Assistant, Docker, Proxmox, MQTT)  
- Data analysis and visualization (Python, MongoDB, Postgres, Grafana)  

## Selected Projects

- **Embedded sensor platforms** — hardware prototyping, firmware, and calibration systems  
- **Calibration & analysis tools** — Python and MongoDB workflows integrated with device tooling  
- **Self-hosted home automation stack** — Home Assistant, Plex, Paperless-NGX, Zigbee2MQTT
